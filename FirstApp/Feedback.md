#### Notes

`rick.mp4` was linked to from a folder outside your git repo, so the project failed to compile. There is a check box, when importing external files, to include in the project directory. Make sure that is on to make a copy of the file in the project directory. Happens all the time! Also, the view controller with the video did need to have 3 different UIViews.
