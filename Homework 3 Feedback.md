## Base Score

7/7 = 80%



## Extras

10 - Not sure what the last 3 keywords are in reference to. If that's something someone will search on, that'd make sense to put into the key words. As for the logo, I like A if you make it fill the space a bit more. Option C doesn't really show what the app does but seems like another map app. D is also good but reads more like "Tog" than Tag with the circle around it, even though I think it looks the best.



# Final Score
