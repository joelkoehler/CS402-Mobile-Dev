# Dartboard

### Description 

Dartboard is an iOS app that was created to spark adventure. Using the device location, Dartboard 
will "throw a dart" at a random location within a specified mi/km range. The user can continue 
throwing darts until they reach a location of interest, at which point Dartboard can:
* Begin navigating there via Apple Maps
* Open up an interactive 3D map via Google Streetview
* Save the coordinates for later in a list of favorites 

Whether you're looking to find a new skate spot, explore your neighborhood, or pick a city for
a spontaneous road trip, Dartboard has you covered.

### Usage

Dartboard is in the "Final Project" folder. This was a final project for a mobile development course 
at Boise State University, so there are other class artifacts present that can be ignored.
